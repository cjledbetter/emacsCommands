#+AUTHOR: Chris Ledbetter

* Introduction
  This is a review of the 2016 Dynastar Glory 84 skis I just purchased
  for my wife
 
** Goals
*** Buying Experience
  - Merchant
  - Customer Service
  - Selection
  - Shipping: Time and Cost
  - Reason chose merchant
*** Impressions
  - Unboxing
  - Condition
  - Graphics
  - Skis and Bindings
  - Bottoms
*** Statistics
  - Weight
    * skis
    * bindings
    * total
  - dimensions
  - other stats found on evo site
  - factory edge angles: 1, 1 (let me know if incorrect)
    * Info from: [[http://thepisteoffice.com/index.php/edge-angles-wax-data/15-ski-manufacturers-edge-angle-specifications.html][Factory Edge Angle Guide]]
    * Not going to change angles for her and see how it goes.  My preference for
      her is a 1, 2.
  - Flex
  - Put skis in Pic for camber and then squeeze.
*** Phylosophy for purchase
  - Pocono skiing (Blue Mountain Resort)
  - Mostly man-made snow
  - Conditions change often (not just hard-pack)
  - one ski quiver
  - previous ski too narrow, too heavy
  - picked women's ski - seems co.'s starting to build skis specifically for women
   * lighter skis
   * different flex and sidewall construction (?)
   * Graphics more feminine
  - new vs. used
   * never owned used ski
   * want tool that will take skiing to next level (advanced)
   * careful skier - so hopefully something that can be skiid at variable speeds
  - Pugski sponsor - I identified skis and Glory 84 and Yumi were at top of list
   * Made sure to check sponsors to see if comparable pricing
   * liked Yumi graphics better and did not have tip protector
    - one Pugski comment noted that she did not like Glory as much as Yumi because
      she thought Yumi was better for her larger frame
    - This made me think the Glory may be have a little more flex which is a good thing
      for my wife who I presume has a smaller frame
*** Conclusion
  - Ultimately won't know until skiid.
  - Very happy with purchase and merchant
  - Will provide updated review once on snow (Decemberish)
  - Love to hear your comments: How important is weight of ski to you?  Any parameters
    I should have considered not mentioned?  Any wrong facts.
Cheers
